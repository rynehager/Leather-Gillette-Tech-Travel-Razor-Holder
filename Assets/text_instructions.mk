Some leather you like (Full-grain vegetable tan master race)
Snaps (if you want a snap close, you could just do a hole and a nice post to be easier)
Snap sets (same as above)
Hole punch for snaps or post
Something to cut the leather with
An awl to punch holes
A pair of large and emasculating leather sewing needles for the...
Thick waxed thread
The original construction was three piece. You could do it in two, but with three you can have the top grain face under the razor and head, so it will slide in and out more easily.
You've got three pieces to cut:
Exterior Face (6"x3")
Interior Center Back (2"x3")
Strap (5.25"x2")
You may have to fudge those numbers a bit larger or smaller depending on the thickness of the leather you use. For notes, those numbers are for 6 oz leather on the "Exterior Face" piece, and 3-4 oz on the others.
Cut the three pieces out, then fold the "Strap" in half and cut a bit off each side from fold to the edges, to try to make an elegant half-circle cutout on either side. Subsequently fail.
Measure the center of the "Center Back" piece and mark it. Toss the travel razor in the middle of the "center back," grain facing up, and throw the strap over it. Push it down like you are tucking it into some tiny uncomfortable leather bed and punch some holes with the awl to mark where the strap will hold the razor with the stitches you'll do later.
Place an edge of the strap, grain facing up, flush with a edge of the interior center back, grain facing up. Make it nice and square and even (they should both be 2" wide on that side so it should line up), and punch some more holes with the awl to mark stitches. All the way through. Do the same for the other side.
Take the edge-hole ridden "Center Back" piece and place it in the center of the "Exterior Face" piece, grain facing down, such that the 3" length of the center back goes from edge to edge across the 3" width of the Exterior Face. It should go edge to edge. Use the holes along the left and right edges in the "Center Back" piece as guides, punching through them again, to punch holes in the "Exterior Face" piece.
The rest is just stitching.

Saddle stitch the middle parts joining the "Center Back," grain facing up, to the "Strap", grain facing up, first: http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-saddle-stitch-leather/
Then saddle stitch the now joined "Center Back and Strap", grain facing up, to the Exterior Face, grain facing down, at the edges and through all three layers.
Then condition and burnish the leather as you see fit.
It may look like a lot here, but it's actually pretty simple. Just a lot of small steps and holes, and making sure things are facing the right way.
